    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently within the same process. It is used to handle tasks that can be executed independently and don't heavily rely on the central processing unit (CPU). Multithreading is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as network operations and file I/O, as it allows the program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously during wait times, thus improving efficiency and responsiveness.\n",

    "a) run()\n",
    "b) start()\n",
    "c) join()\n",
    "d) isAlive()\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "a) `run()`: The `run()` method is used to define the entry point for the thread's activity. When a thread is started using the `start()` method, it calls the `run()` method internally. You can subclass the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method with your custom code that represents the tasks you want the thread to execute. This method should contain the main logic of what the thread is supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) `start()`: The `start()` method is used to start the execution of a thread. When you call `start()` on a thread object, it internally calls the `run()` method of that thread in a separate thread of control. This allows the thread to execute concurrently with the main thread or other threads. It is important to note that you should not call the `run()` method directly; always use `start()` to initiate the thread's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) `join()`: The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before moving on to the next section of code. When you call `join()` on a thread, the program will block and wait until the specified thread finishes its task. This is useful when you want to synchronize the threads, ensuring that certain parts of the program are executed only after a particular thread has finished its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) `isAlive()`: The `isAlive()` method is used to check if a thread is currently running or active. It returns `True` if the thread is still executing and has not completed its task, and `False` otherwise. This method is helpful when you want to check the status of a thread and take appropriate actions based on its current state.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Better Performance: Multithreading enables programmes to run several tasks concurrently, which can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: By keeping the main thread responsive while background tasks are carried out in separate threads, multithreading can improve an application's responsiveness, especially in user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Since threads running in the same process share a common memory area, data sharing between threads is facilitated without the use of complicated communication protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified Design: In some cases, multithreading can make the design of complex applications simpler by breaking up the tasks into independent threads, each of which is in charge of handling a distinct aspect of the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Due to shared resources, race conditions, and deadlocks, multithreading can add complexity. To prevent such problems, synchronization mechanisms must be implemented properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Difficult Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult because unpredictable interactions between threads can result in bugs that are sporadic and difficult to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: The process of creating and managing threads uses memory and CPU resources. GIL may limit the true parallel execution of threads in some cases, reducing potential performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability: Performance in heavily threaded applications may suffer as the number of threads rises due to overhead and resource contention that may outweigh the advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Non-Deterministic Behaviour: Threads may execute in a random order, which can result in non-deterministic behaviour. This type of behaviour may not be desirable in some applications."

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Deadlock: When two or more threads are unable to continue with their execution because they are each waiting for the other to release a resource that they both hold, this is known as a deadlock in a multithreaded or multitasking environment. When this happens, the threads get caught in a circle of dependency and the program's execution stalls. Deadlocks are undesirable because they can render the entire system inert and necessitate intervention to break. To prevent deadlock situations, appropriate synchronisation mechanisms and careful resource management are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:Race conditions occur when a program's behaviour depends on the relative timing of events in a multithreaded environment, making the result unpredictable. It happens when several threads attempt to access shared resources at once, and how it turns out depends on the precise order in which the threads are scheduled to run. Race conditions can produce unexpected outcomes, data corruption, and hard-to-reproduce and hard-to-debug bugs. Proper synchronisation mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, should be used to ensure that crucial code sections are executed by only one thread at a time in order to prevent race conditions.\n"
