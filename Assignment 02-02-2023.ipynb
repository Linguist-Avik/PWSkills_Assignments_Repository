    "Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Tuple is an ordered group of elements of any type and parentheses are used when ceating tuples. The tuples' characteristics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable:  Tuple cannot have any of its components added or changed after it has been created.\n",
    "Ordered: A tuple's elements can be accessed by their index, which ranges from 0, 1, and so forth.\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can include data types such as integers, floats, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "Iterable: Tuples can be used in iteration such as for loops and other kinds of looping.\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples are hashable, thus, can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a tuple:\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, \"two\", 3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a tuple is immutable. As mentioned above, its elements cannot be changed or added to. This means that we can't modify or update a tuple after it has been created, which makes it a useful choice to store sensitive data that should not be changed."

    "Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why\n",
    "tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, there are two built-in methods that can be used with tuples:\n",
    "a) count(): This method returns the number of times a specified element appears in the tuple. Eg., my_tuple.count()\n",
    "b) index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the tuple. Eg., my_tuple.index()\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to tuples, which have only two built-in methods, lists in Python have many more. This is due to the fact that tuples are designed to be immutable, or that they cannot be changed after being created. Methods that change a tuple's contents are therefore not as frequently required. On the other hand, since lists are meant to be mutable, there are a lot more methods available that can be used to modify a list's content, such as append(), insert(), remove(), and sort ()."
